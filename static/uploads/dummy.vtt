topic which I would like to

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/3785-0
00:08:52.086 --> 00:08:58.289
When introduce and before I hand

00:08:58.289 --> 00:09:01.766
topic is our Gallup employee
survey.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/3812-0
00:09:02.856 --> 00:09:07.723
So at this one I would like to
introduce, as you mentioned it

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/3812-1
00:09:07.723 --> 00:09:10.706
will remember we did the top top
bar.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/3832-0
00:09:10.716 --> 00:09:16.936
So we started 2019 visit survey
and also did one in 21.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/3851-0
00:09:16.946 --> 00:09:20.816
And then finally, we'll seemed
also diabat in in 2022.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/3858-0
00:09:21.406 --> 00:09:24.956
So this was a really great
achievement.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/3894-0
00:09:25.016 --> 00:09:28.200
There were many of you
participating, which was really

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/3894-1
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.730
great and we received a lot of
helpful information, feedback

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/3894-2
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.466
and also initiates afterwards.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/3904-0
00:09:33.476 --> 00:09:39.596
A lot of initiatives and
implemented the various changes.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/3936-0
00:09:40.816 --> 00:09:46.911
So Galab is is similar, let's
say survey in scientific based

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/3936-1
00:09:46.911 --> 00:09:52.406
survey and why do we change it
from top job to Gallup.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/3956-0
00:09:52.496 --> 00:09:57.571
So first of all, you received
feedback also from the yes, did

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/3956-1
00:09:57.571 --> 00:10:00.926
particularly there top job is
not known.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/3967-0
00:10:00.936 --> 00:10:01.986
So this is top.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/3973-0
00:10:01.996 --> 00:10:04.276
Top is more chill, let's say
German based.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/3985-0
00:10:05.856 --> 00:10:06.416
Umm.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/3987-0
00:10:06.476 --> 00:10:06.846
Yeah.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4011-0
00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:09.797
So they and we would like to
address also the needs of the

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4011-1
00:10:09.797 --> 00:10:13.037
American market in the unerring,
arican colleagues in the better

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4011-2
00:10:13.037 --> 00:10:13.236
way.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4021-0
00:10:14.066 --> 00:10:15.846
On the others have, on the other
hand, then also.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4063-0
00:10:17.566 --> 00:10:23.122
Rico Umm can support us with the
Gallop survey and also we can

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4063-1
00:10:23.122 --> 00:10:28.677
leverage the potential they have
and they have some experience

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4063-2
00:10:28.677 --> 00:10:33.086
already over the years with this
internal survey.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4082-0
00:10:33.146 --> 00:10:38.916
And so we decided to switch from
top shop to gallop this time.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4119-0
00:10:38.926 --> 00:10:43.339
So we using a different kind of
framework, but more or less I

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4119-1
00:10:43.339 --> 00:10:47.822
think the the way of questions,
the way of feedback we hope to

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4119-2
00:10:47.822 --> 00:10:49.316
get will be the same.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4127-0
00:10:49.506 --> 00:10:50.856
So it will be similar way.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4170-0
00:10:51.476 --> 00:10:56.770
So that's why we would like to
conduct this some, it's also to

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4170-1
00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:01.980
get your feedback to get you
insights, to get also again some

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4170-2
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:07.526
hints for improvements, but also
knowing things which are working

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4170-3
00:11:07.526 --> 00:11:08.786
already nicely.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4205-0
00:11:09.036 --> 00:11:14.548
So the survey will be open from
November 27th to December 8th

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4205-1
00:11:14.548 --> 00:11:20.237
this year and we really hope for
really high participation from

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4205-2

So every voice, every feedback
counts.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4226-0

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4337-1
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:10.836
let me quickly grab the pointer
so that you can, uh, easier.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4348-0
00:12:10.846 --> 00:12:12.756
Follow me here on that busy
slide.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4375-0
00:12:12.886 --> 00:12:18.007
So in the first six months of
the year, we could continue our

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4375-1
00:12:18.007 --> 00:12:23.046
success story of the last years
and the grow the business by

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4375-2
00:12:23.046 --> 00:12:23.376
20%.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4413-0
00:12:24.056 --> 00:12:28.601
Umm, which is a great
achievement and as you can see

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4413-1
00:12:28.601 --> 00:12:34.175
this was especially supported by
our strong cloud growth and and

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4413-2
00:12:34.175 --> 00:12:39.406
also a very nice license growth
for the on premise business.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4439-0
00:12:40.196 --> 00:12:44.021
You will later on see in Max
presentation that actually we

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4439-1
00:12:44.021 --> 00:12:47.326
had a little bit, we struggled a
little bit wrong.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4496-0
00:12:47.336 --> 00:12:52.310
The number of customers and but
the on premise systems systems

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4496-1
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:57.520
get bigger and our customer base
cloud customer base continues to

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4496-2
00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:02.020
grow extension or to buy
extensions, additional storage,

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4496-3
00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:06.914
additional users and we also
were able to keep up the renewal

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4496-4
00:13:06.914 --> 00:13:08.966
rate at a very high level.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4517-0
00:13:09.376 --> 00:13:14.438
And so that altogether helped us
to to grow the business by 19%

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4517-1
00:13:14.438 --> 00:13:17.126
compared to the last fiscal
year.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4584-0
00:13:17.616 --> 00:13:21.705
You can also see that we
struggled a little bit with the

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4584-1
00:13:21.705 --> 00:13:26.224
professional service revenues
and this is due to the fact that

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4584-2
00:13:26.224 --> 00:13:30.384
we no longer have for this
migration projects running and

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4584-3
00:13:30.384 --> 00:13:34.687
also we go build up its own
capacity in some areas and that

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4584-4
00:13:34.687 --> 00:13:39.134
is why I professional service
revenue was a bit weaker at the

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4584-5
00:13:39.134 --> 00:13:39.636
moment.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4594-0
00:13:40.826 --> 00:13:45.646
But overall a very strong first
half of the of the year.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4639-0
00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:54.926
That also results in a very nice
bonus update, and so you can see

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4639-1
00:13:54.926 --> 00:14:01.189
it was our target to grow the
revenues from 43.8 million to

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4639-2
00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:02.546
51.8 million.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4761-0
00:14:02.896 --> 00:14:09.130
We actually achieved revenues of
52.2 million, which means that

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4761-1
00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:14.778
we have a target achievement of
104%, which results in an

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4761-2
00:14:14.778 --> 00:14:20.817
current forecast of and bonus
per employee for the first half

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4761-3
00:14:20.817 --> 00:14:27.050
of the year of 2085 tools and as
usual, a quick recap on on the

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4761-4
00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:32.504
bonus rules and the bonus is a
cross salary and for all

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4761-5
00:14:32.504 --> 00:14:38.055
employees who have no other
bonus scheme and you are not

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4761-6
00:14:38.055 --> 00:14:43.412
eligible for the bonus in the
first six months of your

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4761-7
00:14:43.412 --> 00:14:48.963
employment and you need to be in
an unlimited employment

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4761-8
00:14:48.963 --> 00:14:55.196
agreement by the end of the year
when the bonus is is paid out.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4781-0
00:14:57.006 --> 00:15:02.296
And so this is an update on the
financials and on the bonus.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4798-0
00:15:03.126 --> 00:15:08.544
And today I also want to give
you a quick update on our new

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4798-1
00:15:08.544 --> 00:15:09.356
benefits.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4817-0
00:15:09.566 --> 00:15:15.134
And we always try to listen to
the needs of all of you, of our

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4817-1
00:15:15.134 --> 00:15:17.696
employees and very carefully.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4918-0
00:15:17.706 --> 00:15:23.136
And I'm very happy that we just
recently introduced 2 new

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4918-1
00:15:23.136 --> 00:15:28.565
benefits and the one is the
mobility and health allowance

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4918-2
00:15:28.565 --> 00:15:33.807
and we grow very fast and we are
now a team of over 600

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4918-3
00:15:33.807 --> 00:15:38.955
documentarians and so not
everybody has the exact same

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4918-4
00:15:38.955 --> 00:15:44.853
needs and but we believe that
mobility and health is important

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4918-5
00:15:44.853 --> 00:15:50.750
to to everybody and especially
with the rising costs, we wanna

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4918-6
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:56.085
make sure that coming to the
office then and working out

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4918-7
00:15:56.085 --> 00:16:02.076
after a busy day at your desk is
available to everybody of you.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4972-0
00:16:02.186 --> 00:16:07.011
And so that's why we are very
happy to introduce that new

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4972-1
00:16:07.011 --> 00:16:12.168
benefits starting in in November
and in addition to that, I'm

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4972-2
00:16:12.168 --> 00:16:16.909
also very happy to give an
update on the new work abroad

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4972-3
00:16:16.909 --> 00:16:21.816
and work from another state
policy after the pandemic the.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/4984-0
00:16:22.696 --> 00:16:25.906
Uh work environment is a
different one.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5041-0
00:16:25.916 --> 00:16:30.048
As you all know, it's a hybrid
one and it's still very

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5041-1
00:16:30.048 --> 00:16:34.780
important to meet in person and
to get together in your office

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5041-2
00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:39.587
for in person meetings and but
at the other side it's also very

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5041-3
00:16:39.587 --> 00:16:44.320
nice to work from a different
country or different state for a

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5041-4
00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.446
couple of days.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5079-0
00:16:45.936 --> 00:16:50.747
And that is why I'm very happy
that we can introduce those two

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5079-1
00:16:50.747 --> 00:16:55.482
new policies and the uh, EMEA
colleagues are now able to work

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5079-2
00:16:55.482 --> 00:16:58.536
up to 30 days from a different
country.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5129-0
00:16:58.546 --> 00:17:02.564
And the US colleagues are able
to work up to 30 days from

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5129-1
00:17:02.564 --> 00:17:07.067
another state and then you maybe
believe it or you don't believe

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5129-2
00:17:07.067 --> 00:17:10.878
it, but the regulations around
that topic are way more

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5129-3
00:17:10.878 --> 00:17:15.450
difficult than the actual act of
grabbing your PC and hitting the

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5129-4
00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:15.796
road.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5153-0
00:17:16.186 --> 00:17:20.569
And so I'm very happy and we
worked very hard to get those

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5153-1
00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:23.466
policies updated and in place
for you.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5173-0
00:17:24.096 --> 00:17:29.144
Umm, so I'm very happy that we
have those new policies

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5173-1
00:17:29.144 --> 00:17:30.796
available for you.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5186-0
00:17:31.476 --> 00:17:38.239
And with this, I hand over to
Max for a more detailed update

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5186-1
00:17:38.239 --> 00:17:39.236
on sales.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5189-0
00:17:46.376 --> 00:17:46.596
Yeah.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5194-0
00:17:47.776 --> 00:17:49.966
Thank you, Benedict.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5210-0
00:17:50.376 --> 00:17:54.787
Hello again from my side I give
you an update on our say it's

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5210-1
00:17:54.787 --> 00:17:55.356
numbers.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5230-0
00:17:58.316 --> 00:18:01.206
And and yet you know you can
read here quota.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5274-0
00:18:01.276 --> 00:18:06.067
So just to remember everyone
quota is not real revenue, this

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5274-1
00:18:06.067 --> 00:18:10.780
is an artificial number and this
means we count all new and

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5274-2
00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:15.649
extension business for cloud
with a 3 year contract value and

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5274-3
00:18:15.649 --> 00:18:19.026
on premise with a one year
contract value.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5303-0
00:18:19.336 --> 00:18:23.409
So in the first six months of
this fiscal year, we could

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5303-1
00:18:23.409 --> 00:18:27.266
extend our new business by 14%
compared to last year.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5320-0
00:18:27.276 --> 00:18:32.851
Or we could get 4.1 million
quota more in than compared to

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5320-1
00:18:32.851 --> 00:18:33.796
last year.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5326-0
00:18:33.866 --> 00:18:35.456
Where did it come from?

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5371-0
00:18:35.766 --> 00:18:40.179
So here we divide our channel
into record and non record

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5371-1
00:18:40.179 --> 00:18:44.747
channel record channel means
record direct and partner who

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5371-2
00:18:44.747 --> 00:18:49.469
orders through Nico and here we
could achieve an even higher

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5371-3
00:18:49.469 --> 00:18:52.256
growth of 16% and 1.2 million
more.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5380-0
00:18:52.586 --> 00:18:56.056
But overall, our expectation for
Rico was higher.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5444-0
00:18:56.066 --> 00:19:02.069
So Rico only achieved 76% of
what we have planned for them or

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5444-1
00:19:02.069 --> 00:19:07.684
minus 2.9 million and our non
Ricoh channel inclusive our

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5444-2
00:19:07.684 --> 00:19:13.396
direct business could grow by
13%, which means 2.8 million

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5444-3
00:19:13.396 --> 00:19:17.946
more than in the last six months
of last year.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5515-0
00:19:18.496 --> 00:19:24.462
We achieved 2% above our budget,
so we even planned with less

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5515-1
00:19:24.462 --> 00:19:29.947
crowds in our non record
channel, which overall leads to

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5515-2
00:19:29.947 --> 00:19:35.720
this 14% water growth of 4.1
million and on 28% of this new

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5515-3
00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:41.686
business came from Rico and 72%
came from non Ricoh channels.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5517-0
00:19:42.076 --> 00:19:45.186
And that's also somehow the same
for the last.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5543-0
00:19:45.656 --> 00:19:51.213
For the last year, so even as
RECO is growing at a higher pace

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5543-1
00:19:51.213 --> 00:19:55.976
at our non Ricoh channel, still
it's only around 30%.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5577-0
00:19:58.746 --> 00:20:03.681
So when we look at a world quota
by type, which product did draws

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5577-1
00:20:03.681 --> 00:20:06.896
overall again you see here the
14% growth.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5601-0
00:20:07.326 --> 00:20:11.809
Our cloud business grew by 6%
only, that's compared at a

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5601-1
00:20:11.809 --> 00:20:16.056
comparable low growth for cloud
in the last quarters.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5622-0
00:20:16.376 --> 00:20:20.697
Our cloud extension business was
the best seller and we could

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5622-1
00:20:20.697 --> 00:20:23.136
grow by 43% compared to last
year.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5638-0
00:20:23.676 --> 00:20:29.336
And you can see it grew from 6.5
million to 9.5 million.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5675-0
00:20:29.346 --> 00:20:33.314
So that's a really outstanding
what's very surprising here is

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5675-1
00:20:33.314 --> 00:20:37.090
that also in the first six
months of this fiscal year, our

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5675-2
00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:39.586
on premise business could grow
by 13%.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5685-0
00:20:39.686 --> 00:20:42.136
So from 5,000,000 to 5.6
million.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5707-0
00:20:42.146 --> 00:20:46.054
So that's the third biggest
bucket and our on premise

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5707-1
00:20:46.054 --> 00:20:48.876
extension business date somewhat
flat.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5721-0
00:20:48.886 --> 00:20:52.919
It's achieved 98% of our
extension business of the first

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5721-1
00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:54.616
six months of last year.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5768-0
00:20:55.106 --> 00:21:00.092
So when we compare the US, which
means not necessary Docker

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5768-1
00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:04.746
cooperation but our all our
business in North and South

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5768-2
00:21:04.746 --> 00:21:09.566
America compared to EMIR or
everything outside the United

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5768-3
00:21:09.566 --> 00:21:14.136
States, then we see that we have
slightly differences.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5803-0
00:21:14.646 --> 00:21:20.551
Our new business in in North and
South America that decreased by

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5803-1
00:21:20.551 --> 00:21:26.184
2% and here we have even for
cloud business with decreased by

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5803-2
00:21:26.184 --> 00:21:26.456
5%.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5812-0
00:21:26.466 --> 00:21:29.556
The extension business still
grew by 22%.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5832-0
00:21:29.996 --> 00:21:33.936
They on premise business the new
on premise business decreased

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5832-1
00:21:33.936 --> 00:21:34.436
heavily.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5906-0
00:21:34.446 --> 00:21:40.659
So we only achieved 68% and it's
only 645,000 and in the first

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5906-1
00:21:40.659 --> 00:21:46.872
six months and the on premise
extension also decreased by 15%,

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5906-2
00:21:46.872 --> 00:21:52.493
whereas outside the United
States, we could grow by 21%,

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5906-3
00:21:52.493 --> 00:21:58.509
cloud by 11%, cloud extension by
54% and exciting on premise

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5906-4
00:21:58.509 --> 00:22:00.086
business by 23%.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5952-0
00:22:00.406 --> 00:22:05.271
And on even on premise,
extension could grow by 2%,

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5952-1
00:22:05.271 --> 00:22:11.352
whereas I also have to say that
in the US quota this is that RSD

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5952-2
00:22:11.352 --> 00:22:15.936
and partner business where is in
the EMEA quota.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5982-0
00:22:15.946 --> 00:22:20.263
We also have the inside sales
direct and account management

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5982-1
00:22:20.263 --> 00:22:24.436
business and here we had a
fantastic first six months and

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5982-2
00:22:24.436 --> 00:22:26.306
could grow by roughly 50%.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/5990-0
00:22:26.316 --> 00:22:29.386
So that's really an outstanding
result here.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6001-0
00:22:32.666 --> 00:22:34.686
When we look at the sold
systems.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6025-0
00:22:36.426 --> 00:22:44.203
Then you can see that, uh, also,
we had a gross of 14% in our uh,

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6025-1
00:22:44.203 --> 00:22:46.206
absolute numbers.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6033-0
00:22:46.896 --> 00:22:50.316
The number of new customers went
back a little bit.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6042-0
00:22:52.106 --> 00:22:53.746
And the nice thing is that.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6058-0
00:22:54.306 --> 00:23:00.426
I'm a Cloud 15 is still our
biggest bucket, umm.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6099-0
00:23:00.926 --> 00:23:07.394
And the bad thing is the Cloud
100 went back and now Cloud 100

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6099-1
00:23:07.394 --> 00:23:13.965
also grew by 14 by 4 compared to
10 and and cloud 40 state very

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6099-2
00:23:13.965 --> 00:23:18.276
much the same on our on premise
business.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6138-0
00:23:22.426 --> 00:23:26.531
You can see that even when we
could grow our on premise

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6138-1
00:23:26.531 --> 00:23:31.075
business in numbers, which means
then the systems when bigger

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6138-2
00:23:31.075 --> 00:23:34.446
because at the number of
customers went back.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6171-0
00:23:34.716 --> 00:23:39.238
So professional service went
from 163 to 143 uh business

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6171-1
00:23:39.238 --> 00:23:43.522
server does not make any
difference from 20 to 10 and

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6171-2
00:23:43.522 --> 00:23:46.536
enterprise server went from 15
to 12.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6196-0
00:23:46.546 --> 00:23:50.552
So we sold absolute less new on
premise system even when the on

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6196-1
00:23:50.552 --> 00:23:52.116
premise business went up.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6217-0
00:23:52.976 --> 00:23:57.883
I the new business that shows
that we basically sold bigger

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6217-1
00:23:57.883 --> 00:24:00.336
systems than the years before.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6224-0
00:24:01.866 --> 00:24:03.836
Here's some examples.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6284-0
00:24:04.146 --> 00:24:09.907
So, folks wagon was the biggest
deal in the last quarter with an

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6284-1

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6580-1
00:26:19.327 --> 00:26:23.516
week's or no solution and and
DMS and and software event.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6623-0
00:26:23.966 --> 00:26:28.642
So in Spain, Docuware could win
the European technology and

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6623-1
00:26:28.642 --> 00:26:32.851

00:26:32.851 --> 00:26:37.916
what I guess caused much more to
our engineering department than

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6623-3
00:26:37.916 --> 00:26:39.786

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6631-0
00:26:39.796 --> 00:26:41.436
But the sales guys had the fun.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6645-0

And also very nice to celebrate.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6698-0
00:26:50.786 --> 00:26:56.496
Now in Spain we have 1000 cloud
customers, 1000 paying cloud

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6698-1
00:26:56.496 --> 00:27:01.924

happening behind the scenes at

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6758-2
00:27:33.818 --> 00:27:34.526

00:27:43.216 --> 00:27:48.099
So as we are the latest member
of the Docuware family, I'm

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6805-1

00:27:57.296 --> 00:28:00.166
So actually our numbers are very
strong.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6834-0
00:28:00.876 --> 00:28:04.082
It's not that surprising,
despite the fact that we don't

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6834-1
00:28:04.082 --> 00:28:05.656
do any active sales anymore.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6928-0
00:28:05.666 --> 00:28:09.756
Our revenues have actually
increased, so that's a great

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6928-1
00:28:09.756 --> 00:28:14.139
achievement of the team behind

first or second or or actually
after the 35 years that we've

make now is that as many of you
might know, we have been

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6928-5

developing a lot of docu scan
products for quite some time

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6928-6

partners.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6939-0

actually make it to the
pricelist by January.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6982-0
00:28:42.916 --> 00:28:47.104
I'll get into more detail just
after the next point, which is

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6982-1
00:28:47.104 --> 00:28:51.089
one of my personal biggest
achievements that we've made is

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6982-2
00:28:51.089 --> 00:28:54.669

onboarded into the corporate

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/6982-3

docuware teams and Microsoft
Environment.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7001-0
00:28:57.516 --> 00:29:00.445
So I don't have to use multiple
calendars anymore and can

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7001-1
00:29:00.445 --> 00:29:02.616

everything.

So that's a great thing.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7028-0
00:29:03.906 --> 00:29:08.674
And as one of the IT was a big
team effort together with the IT

guys.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7043-0
00:29:09.256 --> 00:29:15.120
Thanks again for that one night
shift that we have spent

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7043-1
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.046
together.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7048-0
00:29:16.856 --> 00:29:17.186
Right.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7065-0
00:29:17.196 --> 00:29:21.449
Regarding the docu scan product,
just to give you a short update

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7065-1
00:29:21.449 --> 00:29:22.626
of what to expect.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7107-0
00:29:22.636 --> 00:29:27.134
So basically we're talking about
two products, one of which is

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7107-1
00:29:27.134 --> 00:29:31.560
docu scans storage robot which
will be available from January

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7107-2
00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:35.129
on on the price list to
worldwide to any docuware

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7107-3
00:29:35.129 --> 00:29:39.055
customer through the existing
partner and direct sales

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7107-4
00:29:39.055 --> 00:29:39.626
channel.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7132-0
00:29:40.216 --> 00:29:45.860
It will be rebranded to Docuware
storage robots, and I'll give a

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7132-1
00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:50.896
few updates later on the year in
the specific department.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7149-0
00:29:50.906 --> 00:29:55.747
So we're currently just using
the laser pointer, starting with

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7149-1
00:29:55.747 --> 00:29:56.976
the QB tomorrow.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7171-0
00:29:56.986 --> 00:30:01.500
I think we have a slot short
slot to give a brief update for

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7171-1
00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:04.016
the sales team on what to
expect.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7211-0
00:30:04.166 --> 00:30:07.606
We're planning a webinar in
November for every one of you

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7211-1
00:30:07.606 --> 00:30:11.284
just now listening to just get
an idea of what these products

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7211-2
00:30:11.284 --> 00:30:14.486
and what they look like and what
they're targeted at.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7252-0
00:30:14.656 --> 00:30:19.128
And finally, the big launch is
planned for January in 2024,

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7252-1
00:30:19.128 --> 00:30:23.973
with the modules being generally
available by then and hopefully

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7252-2
00:30:23.973 --> 00:30:27.326
being onboarded by all the teams
until then.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7260-0
00:30:27.776 --> 00:30:29.626
Now and then there's much to
follow.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7277-0
00:30:29.636 --> 00:30:33.216
As you can see, but I want I
don't want to give too much

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7277-1
00:30:33.216 --> 00:30:34.346
insight right now.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7296-0

I want to keep the excitement
high, so that's it from my side

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7296-1
00:30:39.518 --> 00:30:41.266

Thank you, Michael.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7325-0
00:30:48.486 --> 00:30:52.237
It's inspiring to see Doctor
Docky scans continue success and

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7325-1
00:30:52.237 --> 00:30:54.536
the integration into Docuware
family.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7363-0
00:30:54.946 --> 00:30:58.760
It's also excellent Michael to
have you in our management round

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7363-1
00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:02.574
and I have found our discussions
around artificial intelligence

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7363-2
00:31:02.574 --> 00:31:05.971
and valuable to shaping our
directions on this important

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7363-3
00:31:05.971 --> 00:31:06.686
topic today.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7384-0
00:31:06.696 --> 00:31:10.070
I'm very happy to be able to
give all of you an update on our

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7384-1
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:12.736
company strategy around
artificial intelligence.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7423-0
00:31:15.176 --> 00:31:18.584
Last April, I had the pleasure
to share with you some of the

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7423-1
00:31:18.584 --> 00:31:21.545
outcomes of the AI research
project, and I gave some

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7423-2
00:31:21.545 --> 00:31:24.561
indication that we would
continue with our journey of

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7423-3
00:31:24.561 --> 00:31:26.516
embracing artificial
intelligence.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7451-0
00:31:27.736 --> 00:31:31.387
At the end of June, we had the
senior management team all get

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7451-1
00:31:31.387 --> 00:31:34.626

Vesterheim for corporate

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7451-2

Strategy workshop.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7464-0
00:31:36.256 --> 00:31:39.389
At this workshop, we made some
decisions about how we would

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7464-1
00:31:39.389 --> 00:31:39.806
proceed.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7479-0
00:31:40.176 --> 00:31:43.346
We made the decision to split
this topic into 3 core parts.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7503-0
00:31:43.816 --> 00:31:46.733
Prompting strategy is all about
our product roadmap and the

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7503-1
00:31:46.733 --> 00:31:49.406
features will bring to market in
the near and midterm.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7525-0
00:31:50.596 --> 00:31:54.247
Markus and Rene as VP's for
R&amp;D and product management,

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7525-1
00:31:54.247 --> 00:31:56.376
will be responsible for this
area.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7541-0
00:31:58.206 --> 00:32:02.268
Operational strategy is all
about how we use AI and AI tools

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7541-1
00:32:02.268 --> 00:32:03.666
in our everyday work.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7561-0
00:32:03.846 --> 00:32:07.313
For this we made a brand new
hoshin kanri initiative that

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7561-1
00:32:07.313 --> 00:32:09.046
will start in fiscal year 24.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7580-0
00:32:10.026 --> 00:32:12.878
I will eat this initiative and
I'll talk some more about that

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7580-1
00:32:12.878 --> 00:32:13.706
on my next slides.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7608-0
00:32:14.946 --> 00:32:18.225
Lastly, we believe AI is an
evolving topic that will have a

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7608-1
00:32:18.225 --> 00:32:21.614
profound impact on the way that
all businesses operate in the

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7608-2
00:32:21.614 --> 00:32:21.996
future.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7637-0
00:32:23.006 --> 00:32:26.281
Therefore, we need to be very
forward thinking about the way

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7637-1
00:32:26.281 --> 00:32:29.555
AI shapes are the future and how
we leverage our position to

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7637-2
00:32:29.555 --> 00:32:30.736
address these changes.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7656-0
00:32:31.246 --> 00:32:34.558
Michael Bochmann will take the
responsibility to help us form a

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7656-1
00:32:34.558 --> 00:32:36.886
long term AI vision and
innovation strategy.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7659-0
00:32:37.996 --> 00:32:38.716
We'll continue.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7683-0
00:32:38.756 --> 00:32:41.758
We will combine these efforts
together and share our

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7683-1
00:32:41.758 --> 00:32:45.326
advancements on all three areas
to create synergistic effects.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7702-0
00:32:45.796 --> 00:32:48.922
Michael Bochmann will lead this
effort and will be the owner of

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7702-1
00:32:48.922 --> 00:32:50.436
Docuware's overall AI strategy.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7739-0
00:32:54.356 --> 00:32:57.311
I see huge potential in
artificial intelligence as a

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7739-1
00:32:57.311 --> 00:33:00.824
tool that makes our work easier,
which helps us produce better

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7739-2
00:33:00.824 --> 00:33:03.946
quality results and can help us
improve our efficiency.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7765-0
00:33:05.786 --> 00:33:09.935
Of course, AI, like any other
tool, must be used responsibly

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7765-1
00:33:09.935 --> 00:33:13.540
and we should pay special
attention to our values of

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7765-2
00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:15.376
diamond, dynamism, passion.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7789-0
00:33:15.586 --> 00:33:20.422
But most important decency we
are and will always be a company

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7789-1
00:33:20.422 --> 00:33:21.726
filled by people.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7804-0
00:33:22.696 --> 00:33:26.038
Reflecting this, we will create
a new team at Docuware called

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7804-1
00:33:26.038 --> 00:33:27.116
the AI process team.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7813-0
00:33:30.646 --> 00:33:32.416
What will the AI process team
do?

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7824-0
00:33:33.006 --> 00:33:35.316
The AI process team will have
many responsibilities.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7848-0
00:33:36.566 --> 00:33:39.824
First and foremost, the team
will help all docu warians learn

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7848-1
00:33:39.824 --> 00:33:42.976
more about the capabilities of
AI tools in small workshops.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7862-0
00:33:43.906 --> 00:33:47.139
We'll guide you through the
effective ways to leverage AI in

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7862-1
00:33:47.139 --> 00:33:48.146
your everyday work.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7898-0
00:33:49.606 --> 00:33:53.011
Secondly, we'll ensure that AI
is used in a way that reflects

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7898-1
00:33:53.011 --> 00:33:56.417
our values as a company, and
we'll stay ahead of the curve on

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7898-2
00:33:56.417 --> 00:33:59.382
the complex future of new
regulations related to this

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7898-3
00:33:59.382 --> 00:33:59.986
technology.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7930-0
00:34:01.906 --> 00:34:05.508
3rd We'll act as consultants to
help address specific use cases

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7930-1
00:34:05.508 --> 00:34:09.166
and processes within teams where
there's a potential to leverage

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7930-2
00:34:09.166 --> 00:34:10.066
AI technologies.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7962-0
00:34:11.696 --> 00:34:14.797
And finally, we'll also work as
a mini development team to

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7962-1
00:34:14.797 --> 00:34:18.003
bridge the gap between what is
possible using out of the box

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7962-2
00:34:18.003 --> 00:34:20.946
tools and where integration or
customization is needed.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7991-0
00:34:24.166 --> 00:34:27.020
I am more eager than anyone to
start this initiative, but we

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7991-1
00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:29.781
have a few steps to complete
before we're able to interact

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/7991-2
00:34:29.781 --> 00:34:30.576
with many of you.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8000-0
00:34:31.716 --> 00:34:33.406
We're still filling our open
positions.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8033-0
00:34:34.636 --> 00:34:37.674
Then we have a lot to do as a
brand new team and we need to

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8033-1
00:34:37.674 --> 00:34:40.763
set our team charter, define our
work management systems and

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8033-2
00:34:40.763 --> 00:34:41.826
create project plans.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8069-0
00:34:43.396 --> 00:34:46.729
We want to start with GPT
training as soon as possible, so

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8069-1
00:34:46.729 --> 00:34:50.287
we'll focus on developing our
curriculum and later this fiscal

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8069-2
00:34:50.287 --> 00:34:53.112
year, you'll start to see
invitations to join our

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8069-3
00:34:53.112 --> 00:34:53.676
workshops.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8079-0
00:34:54.886 --> 00:34:57.116
Thanks for listening about our
AI initiative.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8117-0
00:34:57.206 --> 00:35:00.508

please don't hesitate to contact

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8117-1
00:35:00.508 --> 00:35:03.919
me via teams and if you're super
interested in this topic, we

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8117-2
00:35:03.919 --> 00:35:07.166
have a little teams channel
where we discuss AI topics and

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8117-3
00:35:07.166 --> 00:35:08.596
anyone is welcome to join.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8137-0
00:35:08.806 --> 00:35:10.756
Just send me a note in teams and
I'll send you an invite.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8146-0
00:35:12.036 --> 00:35:14.686
I think I get to hand over to
frabrizio now.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8159-0
00:35:14.876 --> 00:35:17.759
We will talk about another
really important topic, process

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8159-1
00:35:17.759 --> 00:35:18.296
management.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8185-0
00:35:19.756 --> 00:35:24.486
Thank you very much, Sean also
for the exciting update and I'm

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8185-1
00:35:24.486 --> 00:35:29.065
looking forward to collaborating
with you a IT department on

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8185-2
00:35:29.065 --> 00:35:30.566
improving processes.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8263-0
00:35:31.336 --> 00:35:35.769
So I want to give you all the
short update on our process

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8263-1
00:35:35.769 --> 00:35:40.660
efficiency initiative, which we
started in the beginning of the

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8263-2
00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:45.474
year with the goal and this is
just a reminder to optimize our

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8263-3
00:35:45.474 --> 00:35:50.365
business processes and establish
an organization structure that

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8263-4
00:35:50.365 --> 00:35:55.103
helps us all to continuously
improve efficiency and basically

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8263-5
00:35:55.103 --> 00:35:59.077
be prepared for the never
changing, always changing

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8263-6
00:35:59.077 --> 00:36:02.286
business requirements that we
are facing.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8279-0
00:36:03.986 --> 00:36:09.032
And of course, you can't just
start and pick up process and

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8279-1
00:36:09.032 --> 00:36:10.966
make it more efficient.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8298-0
00:36:11.386 --> 00:36:14.800
And there are more important
things we need to keep in mind

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8298-1
00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.076
before we're getting started
with that.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8307-0
00:36:17.486 --> 00:36:20.066
And the first thing is I'm
transparency.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8338-0
00:36:20.516 --> 00:36:26.351
So our first big goal was to set
up an environment that allows

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8338-1
00:36:26.351 --> 00:36:32.186
everyone within the organization
to know and to understand the

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8338-2
00:36:32.186 --> 00:36:34.686
docuware process landscape.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8355-0
00:36:34.796 --> 00:36:37.694
There are a lot of people who
are working within their

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8355-1
00:36:37.694 --> 00:36:38.326
departments.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8362-0
00:36:38.336 --> 00:36:40.126
They know their own process is
very well.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8418-0
00:36:41.046 --> 00:36:44.978
They may even know the processes
of some other departments that

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8418-1
00:36:44.978 --> 00:36:48.726
they are working closely with,
but there is still a huge gap

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8418-2
00:36:48.726 --> 00:36:52.413
when it comes to knowing like
how does it all play together

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8418-3
00:36:52.413 --> 00:36:56.160
and in our opinion it's very
important that this big picture

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8418-4
00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.696
is available to everyone.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8424-0
00:36:58.186 --> 00:36:58.596
Umm.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8459-0
00:36:59.786 --> 00:37:04.355
And secondly, it should be
available as with all

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8459-1
00:37:04.355 --> 00:37:10.136
information around processes,
policies and guidelines in a in

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8459-2
00:37:10.136 --> 00:37:16.104
a way that it's easy to consume
and also enjoyable, and I know.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8459-3
00:37:16.104 --> 00:37:17.036
Enjoyable.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8468-0
00:37:17.086 --> 00:37:19.076
Yeah, searching for information.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8489-0
00:37:19.126 --> 00:37:24.287
This is probably a word that is
the least associated with,

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8489-1
00:37:24.287 --> 00:37:28.136
because we all know you look for
something.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8528-0
00:37:28.146 --> 00:37:32.870
Maybe you want to book a new you
want to book a travel to to

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8528-1
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:37.748
visit clients location, or you
want to visit the Beacon Office

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8528-2
00:37:37.748 --> 00:37:39.606
in the US or vice versa.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8557-0
00:37:39.976 --> 00:37:43.473
And you know, there's been a
guideline around travel and

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8557-1
00:37:43.473 --> 00:37:47.337
expense and handling etcetera
and you know, OK, there might be

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8557-2
00:37:47.337 --> 00:37:47.766
an SOP.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8596-0
00:37:47.776 --> 00:37:50.905
So you look in docuware, you
might go to confluence, you

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8596-1
00:37:50.905 --> 00:37:54.418
might remember, hey, there was a
teams post about that and this

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8596-2
00:37:54.418 --> 00:37:57.546
can be frustrating and this is
what I mean by enjoyable.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8630-0
00:37:57.656 --> 00:38:02.079
We want to make sure that this
information is well prepared and

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8630-1
00:38:02.079 --> 00:38:06.433
accessible in a specific place
where everyone knows where they

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8630-2
00:38:06.433 --> 00:38:10.856
can look for it and find their
information as fast as possible.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8632-0
00:38:12.156 --> 00:38:12.486
Umm.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8645-0
00:38:12.596 --> 00:38:17.736
Also another sorry, I moved too
far.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8654-0
00:38:17.896 --> 00:38:21.786
Another very important point is
inclusiveness.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8697-0
00:38:22.146 --> 00:38:25.705
When we are talking about
processes, we are often talking

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8697-1
00:38:25.705 --> 00:38:29.447
in smaller groups, discussing
ideas, preparing a lot, making

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8697-2
00:38:29.447 --> 00:38:33.128
sure that the process is maybe
fit a certain organizational

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8697-3
00:38:33.128 --> 00:38:36.256
goal, maybe fit a certain
stakeholder groups goal.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8706-0
00:38:36.866 --> 00:38:39.856
But we sometimes and I'm guilty
of that as well.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8718-0
00:38:39.906 --> 00:38:42.776
I'm coming from the CRM and
dynamic side.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8732-0
00:38:43.146 --> 00:38:46.196
We sometimes forget that there
are way more people who need to

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8732-1
00:38:46.196 --> 00:38:46.776
be involved.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8734-0
00:38:47.296 --> 00:38:47.756
Umm.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8795-0
00:38:48.306 --> 00:38:51.951
And we want to make sure that
how we are working with

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8795-1
00:38:51.951 --> 00:38:56.000
processes in the future, umm,
makes sure that everyone that

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8795-2
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.982
needs to be considered is
considered that everyone is hurt

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8795-3
00:38:59.982 --> 00:39:04.167
and everyone can raise their
ideas and concerns when it comes

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8795-4
00:39:04.167 --> 00:39:07.946
to introducing new processes or
changing existing ones.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8824-0
00:39:08.136 --> 00:39:12.961
And only if we do all these
three things, we can actually

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8824-1
00:39:12.961 --> 00:39:18.034
make processes more efficient,
because you can have the most

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8824-2
00:39:18.034 --> 00:39:20.446
efficient process by numbers.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8855-0
00:39:20.736 --> 00:39:26.167
If it doesn't fit everyone's
needs, and it if it doesn't help

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8855-1
00:39:26.167 --> 00:39:31.773
you all achieve your goals, then
that efficiency is umm yeah, a

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8855-2
00:39:31.773 --> 00:39:34.576
mathematical or statistical lie.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8862-0
00:39:34.586 --> 00:39:37.636
But not not always the case.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8939-0
00:39:37.646 --> 00:39:41.851
And maybe you remember in the
beginning of the year, we sent

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8939-1
00:39:41.851 --> 00:39:45.917
out a survey to everyone and I
don't want to bore you with

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8939-2
00:39:45.917 --> 00:39:50.259
diagrams now, but one very and
interesting insight was that we

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8939-3
00:39:50.259 --> 00:39:53.843
had over half of the
participants stated that while

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8939-4
00:39:53.843 --> 00:39:58.117
they think we have a, an overall
good process landscape, they

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8939-5
00:39:58.117 --> 00:40:02.528
need to regularly deviate from
their processes in order to even

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8939-6
00:40:02.528 --> 00:40:03.906
achieve their goals.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8955-0
00:40:03.916 --> 00:40:08.956
And to me, this made it obvious
that we are not always keeping

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8955-1
00:40:08.956 --> 00:40:11.276
especially the inclusiveness.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8961-0
00:40:13.126 --> 00:40:14.436
Part in mind.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8974-0
00:40:14.446 --> 00:40:18.526
So these are the four pillars on
which we want to.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/8980-0
00:40:20.316 --> 00:40:20.746
Yeah.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9002-0
00:40:20.836 --> 00:40:24.393
Proceed and on which we wanted
to make sure that we can

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9002-1
00:40:24.393 --> 00:40:26.806
actually work on improving
processes.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9013-0
00:40:27.336 --> 00:40:33.226
And the first thing that was to
do was building a foundation.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9044-0
00:40:33.236 --> 00:40:38.041
So basically we need to collect
the information we need to make

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9044-1
00:40:38.041 --> 00:40:42.696
sure that we even know about our
process landscape ourselves.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9053-0
00:40:43.296 --> 00:40:47.246
And for that, we started doing
process interviews.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9068-0
00:40:47.296 --> 00:40:50.097
So we went through a lot of
departments to a lot of

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9068-1
00:40:50.097 --> 00:40:51.766
individuals and talked to them.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9079-0
00:40:51.846 --> 00:40:53.536
Ask them what are your
processes?

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9085-0
00:40:53.546 --> 00:40:54.466
What are you working on?

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9095-0
00:40:55.126 --> 00:40:58.856
I'm and how and why are you
doing that?

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9118-0
00:40:59.166 --> 00:41:02.385
Not very detailed, but to get an
overview of what is the

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9118-1
00:41:02.385 --> 00:41:04.756
department doing, what is the
team doing?

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9133-0
00:41:05.606 --> 00:41:09.954
Obviously, all this information
from a lot of interviews need to

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9133-1
00:41:09.954 --> 00:41:10.756
be reviewed.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9187-0
00:41:10.766 --> 00:41:15.444
We had a lot of feedback loops
and eventually ended up with a

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9187-1
00:41:15.444 --> 00:41:20.121
cataloged version of all that
collected information, and just

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9187-2
00:41:20.121 --> 00:41:25.024
to give you some numbers, we had
the pleasure of talking with 40

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9187-3
00:41:25.024 --> 00:41:29.928
individuals from all across the
organization, and at that point,

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9187-4
00:41:29.928 --> 00:41:32.266
thank you to everyone involved.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9258-0
00:41:32.776 --> 00:41:37.290
I know that was a lot of time
spent and this is important to

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9258-1
00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:41.582
the whole organization to know
that it's not just process

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9258-2
00:41:41.582 --> 00:41:46.317
management involved, but this is
something that everyone across

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9258-3
00:41:46.317 --> 00:41:50.979
the organization, UMM needs to
participate and did participate

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9258-4
00:41:50.979 --> 00:41:54.901
over the course of the last
months and this was very

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9258-5
00:41:54.901 --> 00:41:58.156
valuable, conducted 100
interview sessions.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9266-0
00:41:58.566 --> 00:42:00.836
As you can imagine, you need to
prepare.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9269-0
00:42:01.066 --> 00:42:01.546
You need to.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9272-0
00:42:02.416 --> 00:42:03.526
Uh, yeah.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9329-0
00:42:03.536 --> 00:42:07.335
Collect your your notes
afterwards, so this is a lot of

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9329-1
00:42:07.335 --> 00:42:11.066
time spent and overall we ended
up with a bit over 600

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9329-2
00:42:11.066 --> 00:42:14.865
individual processes knowing
today already that we very

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9329-3
00:42:14.865 --> 00:42:18.867
likely missed some and then we
need the place to store all

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9329-4
00:42:18.867 --> 00:42:19.206
that.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9354-0
00:42:20.486 --> 00:42:25.453
So we did have a look in a lot
of different process management

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9354-1
00:42:25.453 --> 00:42:29.236
platforms and they were all
shaped differently.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9376-0
00:42:29.246 --> 00:42:33.007
We looked at more simpler tools
like the document process

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9376-1
00:42:33.007 --> 00:42:35.536
planner for visualizing the
processes.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9385-0
00:42:36.026 --> 00:42:38.956
We looked at very, very complex
business suits.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9395-0
00:42:38.966 --> 00:42:41.966
We also considered things like X
and Ivy for example.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9397-0
00:42:42.526 --> 00:42:42.986
Umm.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9413-0
00:42:43.306 --> 00:42:47.001
And with the help of other
colleagues, though, we talked

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9413-1
00:42:47.001 --> 00:42:48.556
with quality management.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9436-0
00:42:48.566 --> 00:42:51.588
We talked with IT security, we
talked with corporate IT in

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9436-1
00:42:51.588 --> 00:42:54.506
general because there's also
some needs on on their end.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9455-0
00:42:55.656 --> 00:43:01.688
We finally ended up with a nice
which is a chairman mate small

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9455-1
00:43:01.688 --> 00:43:05.326
business process management
platform.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9478-0
00:43:06.136 --> 00:43:10.026
It's Cloud hosted runs in a
small data center in Germany.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9503-0
00:43:10.036 --> 00:43:15.894
So we had a bit of an easier go
with compliance and IT security

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9503-1
00:43:15.894 --> 00:43:21.935
on that end, umm, and this shall
be the one place for our process

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9503-2
00:43:21.935 --> 00:43:23.216
documentation.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9513-0
00:43:23.756 --> 00:43:27.676
So we will do a process map
here.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9550-0
00:43:27.726 --> 00:43:32.776
So an overview over the whole
process landscape you will find

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9550-1
00:43:32.776 --> 00:43:37.907
process models in that we even
will document process roles and

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9550-2
00:43:37.907 --> 00:43:42.875
responsibilities and likely a
lot more because in is is very

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9550-3
00:43:42.875 --> 00:43:43.526
modular.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9575-0
00:43:43.536 --> 00:43:47.670
So we will right now start with
the process management modules,

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9575-1
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:51.028
but there's also modules for
risk management, audit

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9575-2
00:43:51.028 --> 00:43:52.836
management, idea management.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9610-0
00:43:52.846 --> 00:43:57.167
So we chose a tool that, if it
suits our needs and if you're

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9610-1
00:43:57.167 --> 00:44:01.701
happy using it, and we even have
the chance to use it for other

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9610-2
00:44:01.701 --> 00:44:04.746
administrative slash governance
use cases.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9631-0
00:44:06.926 --> 00:44:09.947
Yeah, as I said and I won't go
into detail, there will be

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9631-1
00:44:09.947 --> 00:44:10.936
dedicated sessions.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9698-0
00:44:10.946 --> 00:44:15.150
Everyone will be invited, but we
will start from a very high

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9698-1
00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:19.422
level process landscape overview
where you will just see like

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9698-2
00:44:19.422 --> 00:44:23.763
what our core processes, what
our supporting processes and who

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9698-3
00:44:23.763 --> 00:44:28.311
is responsible for these and you
can navigate all the way down to

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9698-4
00:44:28.311 --> 00:44:32.445
very, very detailed process
diagrams for the processes that

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9698-5
00:44:32.445 --> 00:44:33.616
are more complex.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9811-0
00:44:34.906 --> 00:44:39.223
Umm of course this requires
still some participation of

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9811-1
00:44:39.223 --> 00:44:43.616
process owners and other people
involved, so our current

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9811-2
00:44:43.616 --> 00:44:47.701
timeline is that and this is
already started, we are

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9811-3
00:44:47.701 --> 00:44:52.557
onboarding process owners and
the people who we interviewed so

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9811-4
00:44:52.557 --> 00:44:57.027
that they are the first to
actually get into the tool and

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9811-5
00:44:57.027 --> 00:45:01.883
that they can review what we put
in it based on the interviews

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9811-6
00:45:01.883 --> 00:45:06.970
and that they also have a chance
to start filling it with process

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9811-7
00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:11.363
diagrams because we know there
are some process diagrams

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9811-8
00:45:11.363 --> 00:45:15.756
available already and this is as
I said already started.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9838-0
00:45:15.766 --> 00:45:20.333
So we have engineering,
professional services and

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9838-1
00:45:20.333 --> 00:45:25.996
support already in the system
and we are happily awaiting the

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9838-2
00:45:25.996 --> 00:45:27.366
first feedback.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9850-0
00:45:27.376 --> 00:45:30.230
We will make some adjustments to
the whole configuration based on

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9850-1
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.446
that.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9914-0
00:45:30.456 --> 00:45:35.442
So this is also real life user
test that we are doing and then

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9914-1
00:45:35.442 --> 00:45:39.399
we are planning to start
communication around how

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9914-2
00:45:39.399 --> 00:45:43.910
everyone can be onboarded or
will be onboarded including

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9914-3
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:48.817
trainings and training materials
and information published in

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9914-4
00:45:48.817 --> 00:45:53.802
confluence in the second half of
November due to the amount of

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9914-5
00:45:53.802 --> 00:45:54.356
people.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9931-0
00:45:55.826 --> 00:45:59.855
It's Benedikt mentioned in the
beginning of the year more than

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9931-1
00:45:59.855 --> 00:46:01.006
600 docu variants.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9959-0
00:46:01.016 --> 00:46:05.428
Right now, we will likely do it
in two or three batches, but in

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9959-1
00:46:05.428 --> 00:46:09.357
the end everyone in the
organization will have access to

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/9959-2
00:46:09.357 --> 00:46:10.046
this tool.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10006-0
00:46:10.056 --> 00:46:14.484
So everyone will have access to
our process documentation and

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10006-1
00:46:14.484 --> 00:46:18.697
then December and onwards, we
will be working with process

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10006-2
00:46:18.697 --> 00:46:22.768
owners and with process
participants on making sure that

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10006-3
00:46:22.768 --> 00:46:27.266
the documentation reflects and
continues to reflect the actual

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10006-4
00:46:27.266 --> 00:46:27.766
doings.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10061-0
00:46:28.396 --> 00:46:32.952
And we will be improving
configurations in the system and

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10061-1
00:46:32.952 --> 00:46:37.350
then this would be what we
consider our foundation then

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10061-2
00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:42.298
because then everyone is able to
have a look, have a glance at

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10061-3
00:46:42.298 --> 00:46:46.932
our process landscape and then
I'm of course I'm after the

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10061-4
00:46:46.932 --> 00:46:49.916
foundation, we need to do a bit
more.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10099-0
00:46:51.186 --> 00:46:55.232
So on the one hand, and this
covers the aspects of

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10099-1
00:46:55.232 --> 00:47:00.230
transparency and easiness and
the enjoyable part, umm, we have

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10099-2
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:04.672
working on a concept for
integrating information across

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10099-3
00:47:04.672 --> 00:47:05.306
systems.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10117-0
00:47:05.616 --> 00:47:10.146
As I mentioned earlier, it's
very difficult to find

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10117-1
00:47:10.146 --> 00:47:12.846
information and you have SOP's.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10161-0
00:47:12.856 --> 00:47:16.746
'S in docuware we have policies
and conference etcetera and so

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10161-1
00:47:16.746 --> 00:47:20.635
we are working on a concept that
makes that easier, maybe even

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10161-2
00:47:20.635 --> 00:47:24.586
helps us to get rid of some of
the very big and complex as OPS.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10163-0
00:47:25.366 --> 00:47:25.786
Umm.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10187-0
00:47:25.866 --> 00:47:29.709
And then we are introducing a
change management to help with

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10187-1
00:47:29.709 --> 00:47:33.426
the coordination of process
change projects in the future.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10193-0
00:47:34.006 --> 00:47:36.786
And I want to end with.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10210-0
00:47:38.076 --> 00:47:41.659
Yeah, saying that we are here to
assist you in improving your

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10210-1
00:47:41.659 --> 00:47:42.236
processes.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10231-0
00:47:43.296 --> 00:47:45.942
Umm, we want to make sure you
can then focus on what's

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10231-1
00:47:45.942 --> 00:47:47.626
important to reach your own
goals.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10282-0
00:47:47.636 --> 00:47:51.223
So if you have any concerns
around your processes, if you

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10282-1
00:47:51.223 --> 00:47:55.242
have anything where you know you
want to conduct a bigger change

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10282-2
00:47:55.242 --> 00:47:58.952
around a process or you want to
introduce something new and

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10282-3
00:47:58.952 --> 00:48:02.786
exciting and you need help with
that, please reach out to us.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10303-0
00:48:02.836 --> 00:48:08.850
Let us know when we are happy to
help, and with that I am handing

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10303-1
00:48:08.850 --> 00:48:10.216
over to Marcus.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10306-0
00:48:10.396 --> 00:48:11.036
Thank you everyone.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10310-0
00:48:13.936 --> 00:48:14.226
Yeah.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10317-0
00:48:14.236 --> 00:48:15.456
Thanks for Riccio.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10357-0
00:48:15.726 --> 00:48:18.916
Umm, looking forward to
collaborate with you on this one

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10357-1
00:48:18.916 --> 00:48:22.440
as we are part of some of the
core processes and have a lot of

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10357-2
00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:25.462
processes and also have the
problem that not everyone

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10357-3
00:48:25.462 --> 00:48:26.916
understands every process.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10362-0
00:48:27.226 --> 00:48:28.736
So I'm looking forward to
collaborate.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10365-0
00:48:29.226 --> 00:48:29.646
Yeah.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10375-0
00:48:29.696 --> 00:48:31.276
Hi from my side my name is
Marcus.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10417-0
00:48:31.286 --> 00:48:34.797
I'm responsible for the
engineering team and I guess you

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10417-1
00:48:34.797 --> 00:48:38.615
all know this, but in advance,
often of a DORU you can submit

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10417-2
00:48:38.615 --> 00:48:42.248
questions and that's a pretty
new format from earlier this

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10417-3
00:48:42.248 --> 00:48:42.556
year.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10442-0
00:48:43.276 --> 00:48:46.448
And this time we got one
question from a colleague and

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10442-1
00:48:46.448 --> 00:48:49.446
that falls into the engineering
space, I would say.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10453-0
00:48:49.696 --> 00:48:53.256
So I'll try my best to to answer
this question from a colleague.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10456-0
00:48:55.416 --> 00:48:55.866
You asked.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10528-0
00:48:57.846 --> 00:49:01.320
Well, I will not treat the full
question, but basically the

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10528-1
00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:05.084
question is about the quality of
our cloud and and and the cloud

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10528-2
00:49:05.084 --> 00:49:08.790
doesn't have so many limits and
we regularly have the situation

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10528-3
00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:12.553
that a partner or a customer is
really heavily using the system,

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10528-4
00:49:12.553 --> 00:49:16.085
maybe reaching here and their
performance limit and and this

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10528-5
00:49:16.085 --> 00:49:19.096
might here and there spill over
to other customers.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10537-0
00:49:19.106 --> 00:49:23.716
And the question was, will we
prioritize this problem?

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10575-0
00:49:23.766 --> 00:49:28.301
And yeah, first of all, things a
lot for this question because

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10575-1
00:49:28.301 --> 00:49:32.836
what's very relevant, I mean our
product is coming from the on

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10575-2
00:49:32.836 --> 00:49:36.866
premise times when we did not
care about limits, right?

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10646-0
00:49:36.876 --> 00:49:41.183
So we sought a as a software and
if your server is too slow and

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10646-1
00:49:41.183 --> 00:49:44.749
you have too many processes
running on it, it's your

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10646-2
00:49:44.749 --> 00:49:49.191
responsibility as a partner as a
customer to do this where in the

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10646-3
00:49:49.191 --> 00:49:53.430
cloud when the cloud since a few
years now this is our job and

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10646-4
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:56.256
that's why it's a very relevant
question.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10666-0
00:49:57.626 --> 00:50:01.340
And this can only work if there
are certain limits and that's

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10666-1
00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:03.736
why already today there are some
limit.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10683-0
00:50:04.106 --> 00:50:07.616
They're not very well described,
but they are there.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10695-0
00:50:07.786 --> 00:50:10.797
So there are some technical
limits defined in the DOCUWARE

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10695-1
00:50:10.797 --> 00:50:11.256
platform.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10728-0
00:50:11.266 --> 00:50:14.870
For example, some heavily
incoming requests are throttled

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10728-1
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:18.598
already today, so when you cut
fire, too many of them, then

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10728-2
00:50:18.598 --> 00:50:20.896
you're just blocked it just
blocked.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10777-0
00:50:21.146 --> 00:50:25.302
And also I mean if you produce a
lot of load inside the system,

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10777-1
00:50:25.302 --> 00:50:29.132
for example by running auto
index jobs or uh delusion jobs

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10777-2
00:50:29.132 --> 00:50:33.093
or a lot of the things which
which cause a lot of load, then

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10777-3
00:50:33.093 --> 00:50:34.456
at least we are fair.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10798-0
00:50:34.466 --> 00:50:38.200
Meanwhile, it's it's still a lot
of load which is produced, but

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10798-1
00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:39.366
at least we're fair.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10830-0
00:50:39.586 --> 00:50:42.303
It was not like this in the
beginning of the cloud, but

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10830-1
00:50:42.303 --> 00:50:45.504
meanwhile I think this is a very
established pattern that we have

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10830-2
00:50:45.504 --> 00:50:47.056
a so called fair task scheduler.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10858-0
00:50:47.406 --> 00:50:50.980
So that means fair across
customers that means it's not

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10858-1
00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:55.193
the fastest one, not the fastest
scheduler that you can have, but

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10858-2
00:50:55.193 --> 00:50:57.426
at least it's fair in this
regard.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10886-0
00:50:57.886 --> 00:51:01.355
That if you are producing too
much load then you have tasks

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10886-1
00:51:01.355 --> 00:51:03.956
are delayed, not the ones of all
the others.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10902-0
00:51:04.566 --> 00:51:07.386
So that's already at least the
better situation than in the

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10902-1
00:51:07.386 --> 00:51:07.856
beginning.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10910-0
00:51:07.866 --> 00:51:09.856
But of course, that's not in the
end.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10917-0
00:51:10.286 --> 00:51:11.696
That's not where we need to be.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10970-0
00:51:12.386 --> 00:51:16.110
Well, that's why a few measures
which are currently in place is,

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10970-1
00:51:16.110 --> 00:51:19.146
first of all that we are
finishing another technical

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10970-2
00:51:19.146 --> 00:51:22.411
infrastructure, so called
Central Gateway and this helps

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10970-3
00:51:22.411 --> 00:51:25.619
us also in the future to much
easier throttle some more

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10970-4
00:51:25.619 --> 00:51:27.796
incoming requests which produce
load.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10974-0
00:51:28.716 --> 00:51:29.506
That's one thing.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10991-0
00:51:30.076 --> 00:51:34.191
The second is we're actually
went the extra mile and

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10991-1
00:51:34.191 --> 00:51:35.666
collected a lot of.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/10996-0
00:51:36.456 --> 00:51:37.236
Yeah, possible.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11056-0
00:51:37.246 --> 00:51:40.981
And potential limits that we
should have in the product and

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11056-1
00:51:40.981 --> 00:51:44.530
product and engineering and
we're discussing this at the

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11056-2
00:51:44.530 --> 00:51:48.265
moment, it's even up to the
portfolio meeting at the moment

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11056-3
00:51:48.265 --> 00:51:52.249
and we will shortly later this
year will announce and partially

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11056-4
00:51:52.249 --> 00:51:56.233
also enforce in the product some
more limits that we don't have

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11056-5
00:51:56.233 --> 00:51:56.606
today.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11107-0
00:51:57.136 --> 00:52:00.105
So that's active work in
progress and also what's

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11107-1
00:52:00.105 --> 00:52:03.786
happening at the moment is that
we are, yeah, analyzing a bit

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11107-2
00:52:03.786 --> 00:52:07.645
more carefully than in the past
some excessive load per customer

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11107-3
00:52:07.645 --> 00:52:11.030
and the profiles that such
customers have trying to find

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11107-4
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:12.276
some common patterns.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11162-0
00:52:14.226 --> 00:52:18.281
Again to improve stability, but
also to, yeah, save costs just

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11162-1
00:52:18.281 --> 00:52:22.143
to be open if someone is really
executing too many too many

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11162-2
00:52:22.143 --> 00:52:26.133
services, too many or too index
jobs, too many, I don't know,

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11162-3
00:52:26.133 --> 00:52:29.930
creates a copy of the of the Big
five comment in a request

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11162-4
00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:31.346
container twice a day.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11210-0
00:52:31.546 --> 00:52:34.931
This is just all confusing a lot
of load and at the moment

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11210-1
00:52:34.931 --> 00:52:38.431
they're I need to know limits
and that's why we're trying to

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11210-2
00:52:38.431 --> 00:52:41.816
find such pattern and also again
here to take take care of

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11210-3
00:52:41.816 --> 00:52:45.258
better, better solutions from a
cost and from a performance

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11210-4
00:52:45.258 --> 00:52:45.946
perspective.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11215-0
00:52:47.926 --> 00:52:49.156
That's high level.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11274-0
00:52:49.706 --> 00:52:53.931
I don't know who asked this
question, so if you want to know

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11274-1
00:52:53.931 --> 00:52:58.016
more details please don't
hesitate and also get back to me

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11274-2
00:52:58.016 --> 00:53:01.756
for example or one of my
colleagues and we'll happily

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11274-3
00:53:01.756 --> 00:53:06.049
discuss further with you other
than that, that was my attempt

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11274-4
00:53:06.049 --> 00:53:09.996
to yeah, work in this question
and I hand over to Mikey.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11286-0
00:53:11.616 --> 00:53:15.176
Thank you Marcus for answering
this time question.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11289-0
00:53:16.546 --> 00:53:16.996
Umm.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11312-0
00:53:17.506 --> 00:53:23.238
And I would like uh to take the
opportunity to have a short look

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11312-1
00:53:23.238 --> 00:53:27.206
on the next quarter or a little
outlook and.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11333-0
00:53:29.936 --> 00:53:32.515
Basically, there are some
special topics that would like

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11333-1
00:53:32.515 --> 00:53:34.596
to remind you, also give you the
information.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11374-0
00:53:34.606 --> 00:53:39.213
So the first is that there is a
corporate strategy meeting of

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11374-1
00:53:39.213 --> 00:53:43.522
the of the DUP circle and
extended GPU circle on November

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11374-2
00:53:43.522 --> 00:53:47.682
14th, and sixteenths will be
held in Regensburg here in

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11374-3
00:53:47.682 --> 00:53:48.276
Germany.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11377-0
00:53:49.446 --> 00:53:49.926
Umm.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11453-0
00:53:50.286 --> 00:53:54.283
Then also we will work on
finalize and approving and

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11453-1
00:53:54.283 --> 00:53:58.581
communicating the strategic
product code net also it was

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11453-2
00:53:58.581 --> 00:54:02.955
intended to give some more
updates around these days, but

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11453-3
00:54:02.955 --> 00:54:07.631
still we would like to go first
also to the study meeting and

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11453-4
00:54:07.631 --> 00:54:11.929
then no also internally
communicate and discuss a little

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11453-5
00:54:11.929 --> 00:54:16.076
bit further and then have a
separate meeting for this.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11509-0
00:54:17.486 --> 00:54:21.858
I'm still and the next time and

answered, even if you're
shifting the gears to different,

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11509-2
00:54:25.947 --> 00:54:29.613
let's say things we are
producing at the moment and

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11509-3
00:54:29.613 --> 00:54:33.632
working on, but the cloud also
still is something in the

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11509-4
00:54:33.632 --> 00:54:37.086
background which continuously
needs some effort.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11534-0
00:54:37.296 --> 00:54:42.215
But overall, the the teacher got
with will contain completely new

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11534-1
00:54:42.215 --> 00:54:46.686
things, so then and gallop
survey I already mentioned this.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11545-0

participation and feedback.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11566-0
00:54:53.916 --> 00:54:58.286
In November, then also we will
have an easel 9001 audit.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11587-0
00:54:58.296 --> 00:55:04.706
So we had already did 27,000 of
or not all one audit.

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11651-0

00:55:25.386 --> 00:55:29.442
Then also marketing starts
preparing the Docker world and

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11678-1

And this final discussions and
roll out will be, let's say

1ded76ec-410d-4c0b-8845-520e3e0e9fad/11718-1
